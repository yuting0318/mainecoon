PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Lung, left upper lobe, wedge resection
   --- Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, pT1miN0
2. Lymph nodes, para-aortic (1), subaortic (1), inferior
pulmonary ligament (2), biopsy
   --- Anthracosis

GROSS FINDING:
The specimen received consists of two parts. Part (A) is a
wedge-shaped lung tissue labeled "LUL wedge", measuring 8.2 x
3.5 x 3.0 cm. A gray
white tumor, 1.4 x 1.1 x 1.1 cm, is noted 1.5 cm
from the stapled margin, 0.9 cm from the visceral pleura. The
non-tumorous parenchyma is congested and hemorrhagic. Part (B)
consists of lymph nodes labeled as above. Representative parts
are taken for sections in 7 blocks. (A:stapled margin,
B-C:tumor, D:non-tumorous parenchyma, E:para-aortic LNs,
F:subaortic, G:inferior pulmonary ligament LNs) (CYC)

MICROSCOPIC FINDING:
1. Histologic type: Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma
2. Histologic pattern: lepidic (70%), acinar (30%)
3. Cell type: non-mucinous tumor cells
4. Total tumor size: 1.4 x 1.1 x 1.1 cm
5. Size of invasive focus: 0.4 cm
6. Tumor differentiation: well differentiated (G1)
7. Angiolymphatic invasion: absent
8. Perineural invasion: absent
9. Spread Through Air Spaces (STAS): absent
10. Tumor necrosis: absent
11. Pleural invasion: absent (PL0)
12. Resection margin: free of tumor involvement
13. Lymph nodes: all without metastatic tumor
14. Non-tumorous parenchyma: congestion
15. Pathological staging: pT1miN0 (AJCC 8th edition).
